            This Software Licence Agreement ("Agreement") is a legally binding contract between Luris Pty Ltd and

            installs, accesses, or uses any Luris software product.
          </p>
          <p>This Agreement governs the use of:</p>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>1. Licence Grant</h2>

          </ul>
          <p>All intellectual property rights in the Software remain the property of Luris Pty Ltd.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>2. Account Responsibility</h2>

        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>3. Nature of the Software</h2>
          <p>The Software provides analytical, training, and document-assistance tools.</p>
          <p>It does not:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>provide legal advice</li>
            <li>replace professional judgment</li>
            <li>create a solicitor-client relationship</li>

        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>4. Professional Responsibility</h2>
          <p>
            You acknowledge: Legal practice requires independent professional judgment. You must not rely on the
            Software as a substitute for legal reasoning, statutory interpretation, procedural verification, or
            professional supervision. You agree the Software is a decision-support system, not a decision-maker.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>5. Customer Data and AI Outputs</h2>
          <p>
            You retain ownership of all documents, case materials, and information you input into the Software
            ("Customer Data").
          </p>
          <p>
            You also own the specific outputs and work product generated by your use of the Software (such as
            generated questions, redactions, or calculations), subject to Luris retaining all intellectual property
            rights in the underlying Software, algorithms, and machine learning models.
          </p>
          <p>Luris:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>does not claim ownership of Customer Data or your generated outputs</li>
            <li>does not access Customer Data except for support requested by you, system maintenance, or legal requirements</li>
            <li>does not use Customer Data to train public artificial intelligence systems</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You are responsible for ensuring you are legally permitted to upload and process the information.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>6. Security and Hosting</h2>
          <p>Where hosted deployments are used:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>data may be stored on Australian infrastructure</li>
            <li>access is controlled through authenticated accounts</li>
            <li>organisational data is logically segregated</li>
          </ul>

        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>7. Updates and Changes</h2>
          <p>Luris may provide:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>security patches</li>
            <li>updates</li>
            <li>feature modifications</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We may modify or discontinue features where reasonably necessary for security, legal compliance, or
            operational reasons. If Luris removes a material core feature of the Software that significantly
            disadvantages you, you may terminate this Agreement and receive a pro-rata refund of any prepaid fees
            for the remainder of your subscription term.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">

          </ul>
          <p>
            Unless otherwise expressly stated, all fees are exclusive of Goods and Services Tax (GST). You must
            pay any applicable GST upon receipt of a valid tax invoice from Luris.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>10. Acceptable Use</h2>

          <h2>11. Warranties (Australian Consumer Law)</h2>
          <p>Nothing in this Agreement excludes rights you may have under the Australian Consumer Law.</p>
          <p>
            Where the Software is supplied to a business, and permitted by law, Luris limits its liability for
            failure to comply with a statutory guarantee to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>resupply of the Software; or</li>
            <li>payment of the cost of resupply.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>12. Disclaimer</h2>
          <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Software is provided "as is" and "as available."</p>
          <p>Luris makes no warranty that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>outputs are correct</li>
            <li>documents are compliant</li>
            <li>advocacy performance will improve</li>

        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Luris is not liable for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>professional negligence claims</li>
            <li>missed limitation periods</li>
            <li>court rejection of documents</li>

            <li>indirect or consequential loss</li>
            <li>loss of profits or revenue</li>
            <li>loss of data (where you control storage)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Total liability is limited to the fees paid by you to Luris in the 12 months preceding the claim.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>14. Indemnity and Proportionate Liability</h2>
          <p>You indemnify Luris against claims arising from:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>your legal work</li>
            <li>your professional services</li>
            <li>your use of outputs</li>
            <li>breach of confidentiality obligations</li>
            <li>unauthorised data processing</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            However, your liability to indemnify Luris under this section will be reduced proportionately to the
            extent that Luris's own negligence, breach of this Agreement, or unlawful conduct directly contributed
            to the claim.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>15. Suspension and Termination</h2>
          <p>Luris may suspend or terminate access where:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>fees are unpaid</li>
            <li>misuse occurs</li>
            <li>security risk exists</li>
            <li>required by law</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You may cease using the Software at any time by uninstalling and closing your account.</p>
          <p>
            Additionally, either party may terminate this Agreement if the other party commits a material breach
            and fails to remedy that breach within 30 days of receiving written notice.
          </p>
          <p>Upon termination, your licence ends immediately.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>16. Confidentiality</h2>
          <p>
            Both parties agree not to disclose confidential information received from the other, except where
            required by law.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>17. Dispute Resolution</h2>
          <p>
            If a dispute arises under this Agreement, the parties must first attempt to resolve it through
            good-faith negotiations for a period of at least 14 days before commencing formal litigation. This
            does not prevent either party from seeking urgent interlocutory or injunctive relief.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>18. Governing Law</h2>
