          <h2>1. Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            Luris develops software for legal professionals, government users, and organisations handling
            sensitive information. Our systems are designed on the principle that client data should remain
            controlled, compartmentalised, and auditable.
          </p>
          <p>We take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>is securely stored</li>
            <li>is only accessible to authorised users</li>
            <li>is not used beyond its lawful purpose</li>
            <li>remains within Australia where hosted services are used</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>2. What Personal Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>We may collect personal information necessary to provide our products and services, including:</p>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>3. Handling of Sensitive Information and Client Documents</h2>
          <p>
            Our software may process information contained in documents uploaded by users. This may include
            personal information contained in legal documents, pleadings, or case materials.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given the nature of our services, these uploaded materials may contain "sensitive information"
            as defined by the <em>Privacy Act 1988</em> (Cth), such as health information, criminal records,
            racial or ethnic origin, or professional association memberships.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luris acts purely as a technology provider and data processor. We do not solicit or actively collect
            sensitive information for our own purposes, nor do we claim ownership of client data. It is the sole
            responsibility of the user, firm, or organisation uploading such documents to ensure they have the
            lawful right, authority, and necessary consents to collect and process this sensitive information
            using our platform. Luris applies strict security and compartmentalisation measures to all uploaded
            data, treating all client document contents with the highest level of confidentiality. We do not
            access document contents except where necessary to provide technical support requested by the user
            or as required by law.
          </p>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>4. How We Collect Personal Information</h2>
          <p>We collect information when you:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>create an account</li>
            <li>use our applications</li>
            <li>upload documents</li>
            <li>contact support</li>
            <li>interact with our website</li>
            <li>request demonstrations or services</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Where reasonably practicable, we collect personal information directly from you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>5. Why We Collect Personal Information</h2>
          <p>We collect and use personal information to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>provide and operate our software services</li>
            <li>authenticate users</li>
            <li>maintain system security</li>
            <li>provide customer support</li>
            <li>improve system stability and performance</li>
            <li>comply with legal and regulatory obligations</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We do not sell personal information. We do not use client legal materials to train public artificial intelligence systems.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>6. Direct Marketing</h2>
          <p>
            We may occasionally use your contact details to send you updates about Luris products, feature
            releases, security advisories, or promotional materials that we believe may be relevant to your
            professional use of our software.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will only send direct marketing communications where you have consented, or where it is otherwise
            permitted by law. You may opt out of receiving marketing communications at any time by using the
            "unsubscribe" link provided in our emails, or by contacting us directly. Please note that opting
            out of marketing communications will not prevent you from receiving essential administrative,
            billing, or critical security notices related to your active account.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>7. Data Hosting and Australian Data Sovereignty</h2>
          <p>
            Hosted deployments of Luris software are located within Australia (Sydney region). Databases,
            authentication records, and stored files can be maintained entirely onshore. This supports
            organisations that require Australian data residency, including legal practices and government entities.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
          <p>
            We take reasonable steps to protect personal information from misuse, interference, loss,
            unauthorised access, modification, or disclosure. Security measures include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>encryption of stored data (AES-256)</li>
            <li>encryption of data in transit (TLS 1.2 or higher)</li>
            <li>secure authentication systems</li>
            <li>role-based access controls</li>
            <li>database-level access restrictions between organisations</li>
            <li>audit logging</li>
            <li>regular security updates</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each customer organisation's data is logically separated so that users from one organisation
            cannot access another organisation's information.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>9. Notifiable Data Breaches</h2>
          <p>
            Luris complies with the Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) scheme under the <em>Privacy Act 1988</em> (Cth).
            In the event of an unauthorised access, disclosure, or loss of personal information that is likely to
            result in serious harm to any of the individuals to whom the information relates, we will promptly
            investigate and assess the suspected breach. If an "eligible data breach" is confirmed, we will notify
            the affected individuals and the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) in accordance
            with our legal obligations, and work closely with affected client organisations to mitigate any
            potential harm.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>10. Government and Sensitive Information Environments</h2>
          <p>
            Our deployment architecture supports environments assessed under the Australian Government
            Information Security Registered Assessors Program (IRAP) at the PROTECTED level, and the software
            can be deployed in approved government cloud environments where required.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>11. Disclosure of Personal Information</h2>
          <p>We may disclose personal information:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>to service providers assisting in operating our systems (for hosting, security, and infrastructure)</li>
            <li>where required by law</li>
            <li>to comply with a court order, subpoena, or lawful regulatory request</li>
            <li>to prevent a serious threat to safety or life</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While our primary servers are located in Australia, some of our third-party infrastructure providers
            may route encrypted diagnostic or technical support data overseas in exceptional circumstances to
            maintain system stability. We do not disclose personal information overseas in the ordinary course
            of business.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>12. Access and Correction</h2>
          <p>
            You may request access to the personal information we hold about you. If information is inaccurate,
            out of date, incomplete, irrelevant, or misleading, you may request correction. Requests can be made
            using the contact details below. We will respond within a reasonable time.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>13. Data Retention</h2>
          <p>We retain personal information only for as long as reasonably necessary to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>provide our services</li>
            <li>comply with legal obligations</li>
            <li>maintain security and audit records</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Customers may request the deletion of account data where legally permissible. Backups may persist
            for a limited period (e.g., 30 days) for disaster recovery purposes before being securely destroyed.
          </p>

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>14. Anonymity and Pseudonymity</h2>
          <p>
            Where lawful and practicable, users may interact with certain informational parts of our website
            without identifying themselves. However, our software services require account identification for
            security and audit purposes.

        <div class="policy-section">
          <h2>15. Cookies and Website Analytics</h2>

            functionality. We do not use cookies to profile individuals or sell behavioural advertising data.
